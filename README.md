# Stuff it can/should do
* Strava monthly/weekly goals
  * https://strava.zendesk.com/entries/25849004-Set-Monthly-Yearly-Distance-Goals
  * No longer a requirement, satisfied by Stravistix
* Distance/Elevation/Avg Spd/TSS for filtered date/time range
* Gear specifics (these wheels used on this bike, etc).
* Percentage variability on segments (Like CA graphs)
* Top 10's
  * https://strava.zendesk.com/entries/26124004-List-My-Top-10s-or-Almost-KOMs-
* Segments I've ridden where I'm within (x)% of a top 10. KOM/top 10 hunting
* Enabled sensors for any given activity (Is my cadence or speed sensor battery dead?)

# Current TODO List
* Get equipment logging working properly.
* Add maintenance log for equipment
* Setup Strava webhooks to get new activities
  * What happens when an activity is updated?
